<h2>Searchable Chapter Map</h2>
<p>Nearly a decade ago, when I served as front-line contact I fielded dozens of requests a day for the nearest chapter of my former employer. At the time, we had a simple alphabetical list by state -- and in placed like California it was all but impossible to identify with certainty where the nearest chapter actually was for someone on the phone. One winter while home for the holidays, I built a chapter map in PHP. It was really simple with most of the work being done in the rendering of the search results. All of the administration was done in phpMyAdmin, which was cumbersome to say the least.</p>
<p>When I discovered Ruby on Rails in 2011, I rebuilt the chapter map from the ground up. I used OmniAuth to enable integration with Google Apps for authentication, Nokogiri for some background processing of IRS data, <a href="http://apneadiving.github.io/">gmaps4rails</a> for the map, markers and infowindow generation and the end result worked very smoothly. Because Ruby on Rails supports the creation of REST apis so handily, I was also able to use the app as a JSON provider for other services where I needed the dataset (e.g. Google Sheets or Google Forms -- where I was able to use the list to populate dropdowns in custom forms) or the <a href="#irssearch">IRS Nonprofit Data Search Tool</a> below.</p>

<h2>CMS Implementation</h2>
<p>In 2012, I built the Straight for Equality website from a design concept. The design was not designed to be responsive and so the project was not either. In particular, the project presented some unique complexities -- e.g. a multilayed design and a diagonally cropped image that required the use of the Raphael framework. The underlying CMS at the time was Blackbaud NetCommunity, which was abandoned in 2016 for <a href="https://bolt.cm">Bolt</a>. I created the new theme and implemented the 2016 version as a placeholder while the organization executed a transition from NetCommunity to Drupal (and hopefully to a responsive design that is being developed now).

<h2>IRS Nonprofit Data Search Tool</h2>
<p>For nonprofits of varying sizes, there are multiple sources of IRS data. Even limiting it to the &sect; 501(c)(3) classified tax-exempt organizations their filings may be the full 990, the short-form 990-EZ or the e-Postcard a.k.a. 990-N. If there status has been revoked -- that information is in another search and if they are listed on Pub 78 then there is yet another search. This tool uses the EIN to search all of these sources simultaneously and to return them instantly via one single-page app using Bootstrap, jQuery and Handlebars.</p>

<h2>Interactive Open-enrollment Tool</h2>
<p>A older tool of mine, this one came into being because we offered a wide range of plans and there was no efficient way to give people the ability to adjust their coverage and get hypothetical employee contribution amounts without individual consultaition. I combined a <a href="http://www.slidesjs.com/">Slide.js</a> presentation with some custom jQuery to help employees interactively select the optimal benefits package for themselves and to guide them through the e-signature paperwork process. It certainly wasn't a the fully integrated HRIS that would have been optimal, but it met the organization's needs and allowed for a more integrated employee experience despite the number of actual systems behind the scenes.</p>

<h2>Group Text Alert App</h2>
<p>After a series of security incidents near the downtown DC headquarters of my former employer, I created a Group Text messaging app utilizing the Twilio API and Ruby on Rails to allow quick mass texting.</p>

<h2>Invoicing System</h2>
<p>An invoicing system built on Ruby on Rails. After years of chaos around the use of word document invoice templates that were making it impossible to know who had been invoiced and who hadn't or to guarantee any sort of consistency in the process, I built a custom app to record the invoices, allow easy reonciliation of invoices and payments to the General Ledger and also to email PDF copies to clients. It also tracked each email sent through the system, showing when the last email had been sent for tracking purposes.</p>

<h2>Google Docs Letterhead Tool</h2>
<p>One of the things that I found to be missing when working in the cloud with Google Apps vs. working with Office on site was the difficulty in generating digital documents for e-signature (often needing them to be on letterhead). To facilitate this, I created a Google Docs Addon that used a custom private webservice to insert a background layer into a Google Docs generated PDF version of a file. This file is then stored in the document's properties and in the same folder as the Google Doc. This way the same PDF could be associated with the same document and updated from within the source document. I had found that often my colleagues wanted to be able to share a document as a PDF -- despite the relative ease of making Google Docs visible sometimes having a link to a PDF worked better for them. In the second iteration of the tool, I allowed them to bypass the webservice and just update the linked PDF. This allowed them to generate a URL for a web visible PDF (or to post the PDF on a Google Site) and to refresh it from the source document with the click of a button avoiding the hassle of creating a new PDF and uploading it over the original version.</p>
